# EchoDL
Download from Echo360 lessons using Chrome extension. Use when administrators have disabled the option :( 

1. Download the folder "EchoDLExtension". Save to somewhere on computer. 
2. Go to Chome --> Settings --> Extensions (or just chrome://extensions/) 
3. Enable developer mode in top right hand corner. 
4. Click load unpacked and upload the "EchoDLExtension" folder. 
5. Navigate to lesson tab. Refresh if it has already loaded. Right click to get the menu (around the top of the page works) and click Video 1 or Video 2. That will take you to another page with the video to download. 
6. Optionally, open the console (cmd+opt+j or ctrl+shift+j) and the two urls will be logged there. 

This was my first time ever using javascript and I have no idea what is happening honestly. Lmk what you think :)
